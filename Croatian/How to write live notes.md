### Writing Croatian letters

The Croatian language has specific letters that may be difficult to write with a QWERTZ keyboard. In these notes, I use the following substitutes, and run a script to replace them with the appropriate letters regularly.

- `s^` for `š`;
- `c^` for `č`;
- `z^` for `ž`;
- `c'` for `ć`; and
- `d_` for `đ`.

### Tags

To simplify parsing, I may use the following tags:

| Tag    | Use             |
| ------ | --------------- |
| #n     | Nouns           |
| #m     | Masculine       |
| #f     | Feminine        |
| #nt    | Neuter          |
| #v     | Verbs           |
| #pf    | Perfective      |
| #impf  | Imperfective    |
| #adj   | Adjectives      |
| #adv   | Adverbs         |
| #say   | Saying          |
| #fix   | To be fixed     |
| #sent  | Full sentence   |
| #trans | To translate    |
| #tbc   | To be confirmed |
| #rule  | Grammar rule    |
