# Imperativ glagol

## Rules for most cases

Requires the use of **perfective** version of the verb (see [[Aspect of verb]])

- Start from the third person plural in present tense.
- Discard the last letter
- If it ends in -j:

> [!info]+ Endings
>
| Person | Ending | 
| ------ | ------ |
| ti     | /      |
| mi     | -mo    |
| vi     | -te    |

- Otherwise

> [!info]+ Endings
>
| Person | Ending |
| ------ | ------ |
| ti     | -i     |
| mi     | -imo   |
| vi     | -ite   |

For verbs that ends in -ći:
- đ for movement verbs, e.g. doći -> dođi!
- c for others, e.g. reći -> reci mi!
- (there are exceptions)


## Negative form

Two choices:
- Nemoj/Nemojmo/Nemojte + infinitive
- Ne + Imperative

## Indirect form

We can use imperative at the third person in Croatian. For example, if we want to say "Please call my sister and tell her she has to wait for us."

To form this indirect imperative, we use "neka" + present tense.

The previous example translates to: "Neka nas čeka"

## Exceptions



## Examples

Vjeruj mi! -> "Trust me"
Gurni, Povuci -> "Push/Pull" (e.g. on a door)
