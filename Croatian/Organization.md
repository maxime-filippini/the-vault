The folder structure for these notes is the following:

- **Grammar**, for notes related to grammar rules and use;
- **Live notes**, for notes I take during my lessons, which may still need to be processed;
- **Word banks**, for notes that includes lists of words that can be made into flashcards using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/);
- **Resources**, for books and other documents which are referenced to in the notes (note: this folder is not committed to source control.)
